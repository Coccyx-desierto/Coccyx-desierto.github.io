<br>Twenty years in a nutshell：

2000     "Hello World"
        
2001     Growing...
       
2002     Walking、speaking、fighting over a toy...
        
2003     Starting to remember things。
        
2004     As a kid, I was not fond of picture-taking.
         <br>Because I hated standing still.
         <br>Frowned everytime I was taking a photo.
        
2005     My parents still make fun of me cause of this, 
         I just pretend I don't remember any of it.
        
2006     I invented a game in my Elementary school,
        
2007     Which was called "Boys VS Girls".
        
2008     I always chased after the boy I liked. 
         He couldn't overrun me,
         so I often held him as hostage.
        
2009     And to trade girls back from the boy-team using him.
        
2010     This game went viral. Soon banned. 
         Though we played secretly.
                    
        2011     Met my best friend in Elementary. 
                 A transfer. Real good at drawing.
        
        2012     Was the one 1st in class to talk to her. 
                 Still good buddies today.
        
        2013     Junior High was a pain. Way too much homeworks. 
                 Especially for Math. 
        2013     I like Math, yet still felt pointless
                 to complete all these incredibly massive homework.
        2013     I did the HWs selectively. Only the challenging ones. 
                 Teacher didn't like me for that.
        
        2014     Made another friend good at drawing. 
                 We discussed a lot, about books and paintings.
        2014     Started to write a romance novel. 
                 Heavily influenced by Wong Kar-Wai's work, 
        2014     There was this female assassin. More like a hero, Zorro.
                 She only wears long black coats that are way to big.
        2014     Wrote 20k. Not finished. Few friends were willing to read it. 
                 They all demanded me to write an ending.
       
        2015     Troubled. Felt nobody would be good enough for her.
                 Made her leave the city lonely to pursue something greater.
        2015     Friends all complained. For the story not being romantic.
                 I had my standard test that year. Did well on Mathmatics.
        2015     Third friend good at drawing. Isn't that insteresting,
                 that I am always surrounded by art people. I liked it.
        
        2016     High school was relatively loosened and relaxing. 
                 Had free time. Did quite a lot activities.
        2016     I was invited into the math modeling club.
                 Forced to learn stuff that were too harsh for high school.
        2016     Started to do theater. Wrote scripts. Performed.
        2016     Hurried to a different city taking a midnight train,
                 just to see a musical which was newly produced.
        2016     Learned my ass off English. In the name of that,
                 Did watch a lot of films and shows.
        2016     Jimmy O. Yang is my favorite. He is just awesome.
        2016     Founded a media studio with friends. Learned editing skills.
        2016     Filmed feminism, minority kids, big topics. Also ourselves. 
        
        2017    Spent my summer in nearby college, doing simple tasks.
        2017    Like adjusting the optical theodolite for college students.
                That's pure suffering. My eyes were exhausted.
        2017    I questioned: Why not integrading laser into that thing? 
                We did.
        2017    I finished some college credit classes. 
                Psychology. World History. Physics...
                I was just happy to learn new things. Different territories.
        2017    Performed a few shows. Which I wrote. 
                Adapted from Hamilton the Musical.
        2017    The worldwide wave of feminism officially landed in China.
                A former Google employee started a project "TeachGirlsCoding"
        
        2018    I was one of the first ones to join. Taught myself basic coding.
                Emailed the starter to see if I could do something more.
        2018    Set up Nanjing offline Workshop with his help. To be honest,
                not many came. But even helping one person makes me happy.
        2018    Finally received the patent for the Laser Theodolite.
        2018    Stayed up late to finish personal essays. Started from beginning.
                Countless times. Accepted to UCLA at 4AM. 
        2018    Our studio produced the Graduation film. 
                Was on auto-play on that graduation day.
        2018    We partied all night and I asked my friend:
                Does it feel like that scene, "The Story of Tonight"?
        2018    Friend said no, feel more like where it starts,
                where we are going to a new land, seeking "My Shot".
        2018    Summer with parents. Arrived in September.
                Applied Math and Film.
        2018    Found my way into LA Chinese Film Festivial as a volunteer.
        2018    Spent those time with graduates, filmmakers and some else
        2018    When it comes to introductions:
                USC graduates, Warner Brothers employee,
                Hey I am a first year Math major. So Glad to know y'all.
        2018    I hosted the VIP parties and panels.
                Jimmy O. Yang was there. We talked. Still couldn't imagine.
        2018    Back to hometown during the winter. 
                Got my first tattoo. I designed it over this year.
      
        2019    Had to admit, Math is way more difficult than I thoughted.
                and somehow I doubted.
        2019    Took my first computer science class. It went strangely well.
        2019    I talked to that former Google employee. Who now a friend.
                He offered me feedbacks and support.
        2019    I wrote for one week like I'm Runnin' out of time.
                Completed my first Chinese feature length script. 
                Summitted for compete.
        2019    I lost. Got to know some really talented participants.
        2019    
        在他们的建议下开始写短篇和影评，有的发出来，有的给自己。
        2019        我认识了很多同学朋友，前行在各个领域，我的编程能力也渐渐前进，
        2019        暑假三个月我做背包客走了很多地方，一直坐绿皮，偶尔坐大巴，
        2019        经常一个人，有时两个人，认识的，不认识的，
        2019        住青旅，亦住民宿，脸皮薄就住朋友家，脸皮厚也睡火车站。
        2019        回到学校时精力充沛，下决心转了计算数学专业，
        2019        为奖励自己，做了一顿大餐，看了三部电影，买了两个域名。

<br>我的前二十年重点提要：

        2000        我出生了
        
        2001        渐渐长大...
        
        2002        走路、说话、干架...
        
        2003        开始记事了。
        
        2004        我记得有一天，父母带我去公园拍照，我苦着脸不情愿，
        
        2005        他们至今还拿这照片取笑我，而我每次都装作记不得。
        
        2006        上小学了。我在小学发明了一个游戏，叫男女大作战。
        
        2007        男生女生各占操场一边为大本营作战，非常激烈。
        
        2008        我暗恋的男孩跑不过我，只能成为我的俘虏，
        
        2009        我会用他和敌对阵营进行人质交换。
        
        2010        这个游戏风靡全校，很快被禁止了，但我们偷偷玩。
        
        2011        我认识了我小学最好的朋友，转学生，美术很好。
        
        2012        我是第一个跟她相熟的同学，至今也是非常好的朋友。
        
        2013        初中压力很大，学科多，作业也多，尤其是数学。
        2013        我喜欢数学，但时常觉得这样死板往复的作业没有意义。
        2013        我开始有选择地完成作业，只做有难度的题目，因此总被骂，
        
        2014        我认识了另一个美术很好的朋友，我们经常一起讨论书籍，
        2014        我开始写一本爱情小说，灵感来自王家卫的电影，
        2014        女主是个杀手，惩恶扬善，永远穿着宽大的黑色风衣，
        2014        总共写了两万多字，直到少数愿意捧场的朋友催我写结局，
        
        2015        思来想去，总觉得女主太好男主配不上，写女主一人孤然离去。
        2015        朋友为数落我一顿。这年中考，正常发挥，数学考得最好。
        2015        认识了第三个美术好的朋友，身边选择艺术的人总不占少数，
        
        2016        国际部的规章制度并不严苛，我开始有很多闲时，参加活动，
        2016        譬如被拉进数学建模社团，被迫学了很多用不上的数学知识，
        2016        譬如开始接触到戏剧，写剧本，演出，
        2016        和朋友为了一场表演，考前凌晨坐慢车赶往另一个城市，
        2016        同时拼命学习英语，借口看了很多美剧电影脱口秀--
        2016        最喜欢吉米欧阳，太棒了，我一看他心情就好。
        2016        与几个朋友一起创立影视工作室，写剧本，学特效、剪辑，
        2016        拍女权，贫困儿童，平原远山，也拍学校，拍我们自己。
        
        2017        暑假没事跑到周边大学听课，帮哥哥姐姐打下手，
        2017        调整光学经纬仪的麻烦任务落我身上，很难操作，我很头疼，
        2017        在奔溃边缘提出：把经纬仪改进成激光的吧。
        2017        我还上了很多大学学分课，心理，历史，物理...
        2017        尽管有些科目考完再没机会接触过，但我很高兴能够尝试学习。
        2017        我还完成了好几场节日表演，改编了音乐剧汉密尔顿。
        2017        女权观念在国内兴起，有知名工程师发起教女生学编程活动，
        
        2018        我积极参加，自学基础知识，又找办法联系上了这位工程师，
        2018        在他的帮助下，我们在南京建立workshop，尽管参加者不多。
        2018        我终于收到了激光经纬仪的专利。
        2018        每天熬夜写文书，换内容重写了五遍，凌晨查到ucla的录取。
        2018        我们工作室制作了毕业视频，毕业那天在大屏幕上循环播放，
        2018        与朋友彻夜畅饮，问，像不像汉密尔顿里今夜故事那场戏？
        2018        朋友说，更像那几首开场曲，我们将远渡重洋，出人头地。
        2018        暑假我赖着父母。两个月后来到ucla，学习应用数学与电影。
        2018        初来乍到，网上看到电影节信息，厚着脸皮去打下手，
        2018        和一群研究生、博士、职业电影人厮混在一起，
        2018        轮流自我介绍：usc研究生，华纳职员，数学专业大一新生。
        2019        数学课程难度很大，时隔已久感到压力，我开始怀疑我的选择，
        2018        电影节工作中我接待了吉米欧阳，特别开心。
        2018        寒假回家，赶着十八岁的尾巴，纹自己设计的第一个纹身。
  
        2019        我选了第一门计算机课程，比我接触过的难，但比纯数学有趣，
        2019        我询问那位工程师朋友的建议，他给了我莫大的支持和鼓励。
        2019        我三天没睡觉，一周内完成了第一部中文长篇剧本，参加比赛，
        2019        比赛没有获奖，但我认识了很多国内外华人编剧朋友，
        2019        在他们的建议下开始写短篇和影评，有的发出来，有的给自己。
        2019        我认识了很多同学朋友，前行在各个领域，我的编程能力也渐渐前进，
        2019        暑假三个月我做背包客走了很多地方，一直坐绿皮，偶尔坐大巴，
        2019        经常一个人，有时两个人，认识的，不认识的，
        2019        住青旅，亦住民宿，脸皮薄就住朋友家，脸皮厚也睡火车站。
        2019        回到学校时精力充沛，下决心转了计算数学专业，
        2019        为奖励自己，做了一顿大餐，看了三部电影，买了两个域名。
